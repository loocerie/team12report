<p>The purpose of this class was to educate students about programming autonomous robots using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Python software. The instructors wanted students to feel comfortable with their technical skills so that they could enjoy this camp and pursue further educational opportunities with clear fundamentals. Students hope to spread their knowledge and help others transition into a STEM disciple.</p>

<p>Instructors taught students how to use the robot’s laser sensor to detect range from obstacles, camera to identify the color of obstacles, odometry to perceive the robot’s movement, and a combination of these sensors to determine where it is in a map. Not only did they learn the theory behind these concepts from MIT and JPL staff, they were able to implement it on robots by following instructions on labs and learn from a trial and error basis.  </p>

<p>Students were also able to experience seminar talks about cutting-edge technology from experts in their fields daily. They learnt about topics ranging from designing hackathons to creating mini-satellites to even getting some insider tips into the admissions process at MIT!</p>
